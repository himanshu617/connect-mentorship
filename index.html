    <h2>About Connect</h2>

    <p>
      Connect is a student career guidance and mentorship platform created to help
      Indian school and college students make better academic and career decisions.
      Many students feel confused about exams, courses, colleges, and future career paths.

      On Connect, juniors can ask questions about academics, entrance exams, college life,

      journeys — share honest advice, lessons, and mistakes so others can learn from them.
      This makes the guidance practical, relatable, and realistic.

    <p>
      Our goal is simple: reduce confusion, build confidence, and help students choose
